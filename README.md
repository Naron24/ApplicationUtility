# ApplicationUtility
The experimental project that can facilitate the development from the abstraction layers

The solution of the exercises (MatchSticks and FactorialFromNumber) is located in the Matches folder.

But feel free to browse through all the code I've read, as I was developing usefull functionality classes,
that can help me develop any applications in the future.
